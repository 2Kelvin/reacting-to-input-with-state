# reacting-to-input-with-state

In this documentation read about managing form state, I learn:

- to use `react's declarative UI method` rather than `vanilla javascript imperative method`
- to at first `visualize all the different UI states a user might see` e.g. success page, error page etc
- to `create mock ups for the different states before adding logic`. So that when you finally add the logic you'll just 'link' the mockups as UI components
